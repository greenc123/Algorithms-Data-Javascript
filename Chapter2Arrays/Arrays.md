JAGGED ARRAYS

A Jagged arrays is an array where the rows in the array may have
a different number of elements.

One row may have three elements
Another may have five elements
another may have just one element.

Many languages have problems with jagged arrays, but javascript 
does not since we can compute the length of any row
